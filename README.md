Advanced SSL Pinning Bypass and Anti-Root Detection Script
Overview:
This script provides advanced capabilities for bypassing SSL pinning and anti-root detection mechanisms commonly employed in Android applications. It combines multiple techniques to effectively circumvent security measures and enable dynamic analysis of network traffic on rooted devices.

Features:
SSL Pinning Bypass:

Dynamically re-pins SSL connections by hooking into SSLContext.init() method.
Loads custom CA certificate from file to establish trust with target servers.
Handles various SSL pinning implementations, including certificate pinning and public key pinning.
Anti-Root Detection Evasion:

Evades root detection mechanisms by bypassing common root checks such as file existence and package name verification.
Overrides device properties and system calls to disguise device characteristics and system integrity.
Dynamic Analysis Support:

Enables dynamic analysis of encrypted network traffic for security testing and debugging purposes.
Provides a flexible framework for analyzing SSL-secured communication in real-time.
Extensibility and Customization:

Modular design allows for easy customization and extension of bypass techniques.
Can be adapted to target specific SSL pinning implementations and root detection mechanisms.
Error Handling and Logging:

Robust error handling and logging mechanisms provide visibility into script execution and troubleshooting of potential issues.
Helps identify and address errors encountered during SSL pinning bypass and anti-root detection evasion.
Usage:
Ensure the target Android application is installed on a rooted device or emulator.
Push the custom CA certificate (cert-der.crt) to the device's local storage (/data/local/tmp/).
Run the Frida script using the Frida framework on the target device, specifying the package name of the target application.
frida -U -f <package_name> -l frida-ssl-pinning-bypass.js --no-pause


Monitor the console output for confirmation of SSL pinning bypass and anti-root detection evasion.
